		"description": "The Overture Maps Foundation intends to power current and next-generation map products by creating reliable, easy-to-use, and interoperable open map data. We incorporate map data from multiple sources including Overture members, government organizations, and open data sources including OpenStreetMap, map it to a common schema for ease of consumption, and assign/manage stable identifiers to allow data consumers to more easy connect datasets together. \n\nOverture Maps Foundation is a Joint Development Foundation Project, an affiliate of the Linux Foundation.",
