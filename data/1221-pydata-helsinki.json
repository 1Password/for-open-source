		"description": "There is a PyData Helsinki meetup group that has existed for years, but the original organizers seem to have disappeared and there has been a long hiatus. I represent a new team that took over the group with help from NumFOCUS and is now rebooting the meetups. We primarily need a team password manager for a few social media accounts such as our Fosstodon account pydata_helsinki.\n\nThis meetup is for those who work or aspire to work in fields like machine learning, data engineering, MLOps, visualization, and statistical modeling. We share real-world experiences about solving problems in these fields using open-source tools, including but not limited to Python and its libraries – users of R, Julia or other languages are welcome.",
