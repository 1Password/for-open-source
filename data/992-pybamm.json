		"description": "PyBaMM (Python Battery Mathematical Modelling) is an open-source battery simulation package written in Python. Our mission is to accelerate battery modelling research by providing open-source tools for multi-institutional, interdisciplinary collaboration. Broadly, PyBaMM consists of (i) a framework for writing and solving systems of differential equations, (ii) a library of battery models and parameters, and (iii) specialized tools for simulating battery-specific experiments and visualizing the results. Together, these enable flexible model definitions and fast battery simulations, allowing users to explore the effect of different battery designs and modeling assumptions under a variety of operating scenarios.",
