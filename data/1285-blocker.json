		"description": "Blocker is a component controller for Android applications that currently supports using PackageManager and Intent Firewall to manage the state of components. For bloated applications, many components within the application are redundant. Blocker provides a convenient control button to manage the corresponding components, enabling the disabling of unnecessary functions and saving application runtime resources.\nBlocker can be seamlessly switched between these controllers, and for application rules, you can export and import them. Additionally, it is compatible with backup files generated by MyAndroidTools, and you can effortlessly convert them to Intent Firewall rules. The application also has the potential to be extended in the future.",
