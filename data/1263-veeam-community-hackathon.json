We are hosting this event for the third consecutive year.\n\nSince we started this event, password sharing has been a challenge, particularly as the team has grown. We are currently four people in the organizersâ€™ team\n\nThe code developed during the event is private until judging is complete. From that moment forward, the code will be public.",
