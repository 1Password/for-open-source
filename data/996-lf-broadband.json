		"description": "VOLTHA is an open source project for PON broadband access equipment, supporting the principle of multi-vendor, disaggregated, “any broadband access as a service” for the Central Office. VOLTHA provides isolation between an abstract (vendor agnostic) PON management system, and a set of vendor-specific and white-box PON hardware devices.\n\nOn its north-bound interface, VOLTHA provides a set of abstract APIs that enable the PON network to appear as a programmable Ethernet switch to an SDN controller.  On its south-bound side, VOLTHA communicates with PON hardware devices using vendor-specific protocols through OLT and ONU adapters.\n\nVOLTHA is in production with major operators, including Deutsche Telekom, Turk Telekom, and Reliance Jio.",
