# 1Password for Open Source Projects

We rely on open source software every day to develop 1Password. It's fair to say that 1Password wouldn't exist without the open source community, so we want to give back and help teams be more productive and secure.

Are you working on an open source project that needs a password manager? How about a secure place to keep and share secrets — social media logins, code signing certificates, ssh keys, etc? We've got your back: get 1Password Teams free on us.

## How to apply

## Requirements

To apply, you need to be a core contributor for an active open source project that is at least 30 days old. We’ll also accept applications from the organisers of community meetups and events, as well as some conferences.

Projects need to use a standard open source license and must be non-commercial. If your company is looking for an enterprise password manager, check out [1Password Business](https://1password.com/business/).

If you're not sure if your project meets these requirements, ask us [@1Password](https://twitter.com/1password) or opensource@1password.com.
