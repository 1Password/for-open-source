It is developed by a team of students from the Internet Technology College of Yunnan Agricultural Vocational and Technical College, dedicated to solving various problems in traditional food - ordering models and enhancing the campus food - ordering experience.\n1. Project Background and Objectives\nTraditional food ordering has issues such as complex processes, insecure transactions, and low - efficiency deliveries. Nongzhibang aims to revolutionize the food - ordering model through a mobile mini - program, improving the ordering and delivery speed, ensuring transaction security and delivery quality, and serving both users and merchants.\n2. Solutions\n    - Convenient User Ordering: The interface is newly designed and easy to operate. It supports voice - recognition search. Users can browse products, settle accounts, select delivery addresses, and check order statuses.\n    - Easy Merchant Operation: Merchants can add products efficiently. After uploading licenses and passing the review, they can put products on the shelves. New orders are notified by voice, and they can update order statuses.\n    - Secure Transactions: It supports both online and offline transactions. Detailed transaction information is generated for easy verification, ensuring transaction security.\n    - Efficient Delivery Service: Merchants can assign deliverymen. Deliverymen can calculate delivery locations and handle multiple orders, improving efficiency and reducing error rates.\n3. Technical Realization\n    - Color UI Design: It adopts a unified standard for design and interaction controls, follows the Color UI specification, adheres to the minimalist design principle, realizes modular construction, improves user experience, and facilitates function iteration.\n    - Cloud Development: It uses a cloud - developed database with high - performance read - write services. The response speed is 30% faster than that of traditional databases. It is lightweight, highly secure, and highly accurate.\n    - Instant Messaging: After a successful transaction, it notifies merchants immediately through voice prompts and pop - up windows to avoid missed orders.\n    - Simultaneous Interpretation: It supports users to search for products by voice, combined with text input, improving search convenience.\n    - Tencent Map: It is used to obtain location information, facilitating users and merchants to fill in delivery and store locations.\n4. Function Demonstration\n    - User - end: The main interface displays products. The ordering interface shows product and store details. The order confirmation interface allows users to modify delivery addresses and select payment methods. The order information interface provides transaction vouchers.\n    - Merchant - end: Merchants need to be real - name authenticated when joining. The store management interface can be used to complete store information. They can manage product categories and add products for convenient operation.\n5. Future Plans\nIt will add an instant messaging function to facilitate communication among users, deliverymen, and merchants. It also plans to adopt the NFC touch - to - pick - up function. Users can complete the delivery and pick - up service by touching with NFC without showing order information.","contributors":4,"home_url":"https://github.com/vmuu/nongzhibang","repo_url":"https://github.com/vmuu/nongzhibang","license_type":"Apache-2.0","license_url":"https://github.com/vmuu/nongzhibang/blob/master/LICENSE","is_event":false,"is_team":false},"issue_number":1100,"created_at":"2025-03-11T08:20:17Z"},{"project":{"name":"OKD","description":"OKD is a very opinionated distribution of Kubernetes.\n\nWe add some features directly as modifications into Kubernetes, but mostly we augment the platform by “preinstalling” a large amount of pieces of software called “Operators” into the deployed cluster.\n\nThese operators then provide all of our cluster components (over 100 of them!) which make up the platform, such as OS upgrades, web consoles, monitoring and image building\n\nThe project also produces OKDerators.

The first is the concept of Universal Basic Income, which is a promising path towards a more equal and inclusive society. The second is the use of direct and anticipatory cash transfers to people living in poverty. Research has shown that those who receive direct aid greatly benefit from the money and that they reinvest it locally, responsibly, and successfully.\n\nWe make an impact by sending regular long-term cash transfers directly to recipients: from person to person, because many of the world's poorest countries lack solid social infrastructure.

This system transcends being merely a digital repository of patient records, evolving into a platform that supports advanced TeleICU capabilities.\n\nOHC represents a unique fusion of professional expertise and community-driven innovation, primarily fueled by a small team of dedicated developers and a dynamic community of college students. This collaborative model showcases a new paradigm in healthcare technology, emphasizing impactful, sustainable, and scalable solutions.\n\nOriginally a volunteer-driven initiative during the COVID-19 pandemic, OHC has continually addressed citizen-level healthcare problems. Its CARE software, adopted by several Indian states, played a crucial role in optimizing healthcare resource management during the pandemic. As the pandemic waned, CARE evolved to support the 10BedICU Project, enabling technology-driven ICU care in rural India and providing TeleICU services to the remotest regions, impacting thousands of lives.\n\nToday, beyond the 10BedICU Project, CARE is being adopted for various healthcare applications, including palliative care digitization, demonstrating its adaptability and growing significance in improving healthcare delivery across diverse settings. OHC's journey is a testament to the transformative impact of youth-driven initiatives in healthcare, touching the lives of millions across India.","contributors":25,"home_url":"https://ohc.network/","repo_url":"https://github.com/coronasafe/","license_type":"MIT","license_url":"https://github.com/coronasafe/care/blob/develop/LICENSE","is_event":false,"is_team":true},"issue_number":922,"created_at":"2024-03-23T21:13:44Z"},{"project":{"name":"Apache Cordova","description":"An open-source mobile development framework that allows developers to use standard web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript) for cross-platform development.","contributors":99,"home_url":"https://cordova.apache.org/","license_type":"Apache-2.0","is_event":false,"is_team":false},"issue_number":926,"created_at":"2024-03-27T05:33:25Z"},{"project":{"name":"HashiCorp Korea User Group","description":"HashiCorp Korea User Group is a South Korea based HashiCorp users and contributors community for anyone interested in HashiCorp products and its OSS projects like Terraform, Packer, Consul, Vault, Nomad and more.
