Social Income wants to harness this potential by combining two approaches to wealth redistribution. The first is the concept of Universal Basic Income, which is a promising path towards a more equal and inclusive society. The second is the use of direct and anticipatory cash transfers to people living in poverty. Research has shown that those who receive direct aid greatly benefit from the money and that they reinvest it locally, responsibly, and successfully.\n\nWe make an impact by sending regular long-term cash transfers directly to recipients: from person to person, because many of the world's poorest countries lack solid social infrastructure.
