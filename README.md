# 1Password for Open Source Projects
We rely on open source software every day to develop 1Password. It's fair to say that 1Password wouldn't exist without the free software community. So we want to give back and help open source teams be more productive and secure.

Are you working on an open source project that needs a password manager? How about a secure place to keep and share secrets — social media logins, code signing certificates, ssh keys, etc? We've got your back: get a free 1Password Teams account on us.


## How to apply
1. Create a 1Password Teams account on [1Password.com](https://1password.com). 
2. Invite at least one other team member and add them as an owner of the account.
3. Fork this repo and add an entry to the `Open source projects using 1Password Teams` section at the bottom of this page:

```markdown
### Project name
A short description of what we do. [Link to project](https://myawesomeproject.org)
```

4. Create a pull request and fill out the template with the requested details.


## Requirements
To apply, you need to be a project lead or a core contributor for an active open source project that is at least 30 days old and has multiple contributors.

Your project needs to use a standard open source license and must be non-commercial. It should not have paid support and cannot pay contributors. If your company works on commercial projects, consider [1Password Business](https://1password.com/business/).

If you're not sure if your project meets these requirements, please contact our support team at opensource@1password.com. 


## Membership details
* You'll receive a free one-year membership to [1Password Teams](https://1password.com/teams).
* You can invite core contributors to your team account.
* Team members can use the 1Password apps on all devices — Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, Linux, Chrome OS and web.
* All app updates are free while your membership is active.
* Memberships can be renewed each year if your project still meets the requirements. Email us at opensource@1password.com 30 days prior to renewal.
* Memberships cannot be transferred or sold. 

We will review all requests and accept them at our discretion. If accepted, your project may be listed below.
