		"description": "Stan is an open source probabilistic programming language that enables sophisticated statistical modeling using Bayesian inference. The algorithms in Stan allow for accurate and interpretable results in complex data scenarios. Stanâ€™s probabilistic programming language is suitable for a wide range of applications, from simple linear regression to multi-level models and time-series analysis. Stan consists of a C++ backend for automatic differentiation, Stan Math, a services API layer to access NUTS and other MCMC algorithims, and interfaces for Python, Julia, R, and the Unix shell. Links to all of those can be found on our github part of our website. The Stan project has a rich ecosystem of tools for validation and visualization support decision-making and communication.",
